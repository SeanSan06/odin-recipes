# odin-recipes

This project features 8 recipes: Cheese burger, BBQ ribs, bacond wrapped hot dogs, pepperoni pizza, lemonade, coconut, strawberry milkshake, apple juice. Each recipe leads to a page with an image of said recipe, the ingredient list, and basic steps to create the meal.

Overall this was a fun and exciting 1st project. I got to pratice boiler plating, putting images, relative links, headers, lists, styling, and coloring. These were simple tasks, but it was fun to implement what I wanted into the website. Most importantly I got to practice using GIT and Github to document snapshots of my code which I have to say was pretty fun. So even though I could only put basic content and css styling on the page I am super exicited to learn even more CSS to add more fliar and color to my webpages! The next step in my journey is learning and applying JavaScript!
