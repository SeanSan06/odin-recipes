# odin-recipes

This project features three recipes: Cheese burger, BBQ ribs, and bacond warpped hot dogs. Each recipe leads to a page with an image of said recipe, the ingredient list, and basic steps to create the meal.

Overall this was a fun and exciting 1st project. I got to pratice boiler plating, putting images, relative links, headers, and lists. These were simple tasks, but it was fun to implement what I wanted into the website. Most importantly I got to practice using GIT and Github to document snapshots of my code which I have to say was pretty fun. So even though I could only put basic content on the page I am super exicited to learn CSS to add more fliar and color to my webpages!
