# odin-recipes

TO DO: "Set up your README.md file and write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)"

This project features three recipes: Cheese burger, BBQ ribs, and bacond warpped hot dogs. Each recipe leads to a page with an image of said recipe, the ingredient list, and basic steps to create the meal.

Overall this was a fun and exciting project. I got to pratice boiler plating, putting images, relative links, headers, and lists. Most importantly I got to practice using GIT and Github to document snapshots of my code which I have to say was pretty fun. So even though I could only put basic content on the page I am super exicited to learn CSS to add more fliar and color to my webpages!
